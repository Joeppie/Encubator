# Encubator
Creates Avorion cube ships to specification.

Creates a series of overlapping cubes, which can be fully encompassed within one another, and typically with an outer armor cube.

Currently a very rough demo: you can modify the statements near the bottom to change the desired materials and counts for elements in the cube. The cube is printed to the log.
Runs best in node.js currently.
